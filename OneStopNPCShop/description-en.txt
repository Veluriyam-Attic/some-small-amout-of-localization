The Shop Market is a mod that introduces a single item that allows you to access any npc's shop that is in your town and not homeless.
The shop market can be bought from the travelling merchant.
It has a 33% chance to be available.
The portable version can be bought from the skeleton merchant as long as the travelling merchant has already offered the non-portable version first.
The wall mounted version can be crafted from the standing version.
You can also sell items at the shop market by shift-clicking the item with the market open.
Sell price is determined by your least happiest npc.
If you have any suggestions or bug reports, please report them on the steam workshop page or the discord server: https://discord.gg/SDThAjNpbM

1.4.4.9+: The new shop system allows for the shop market to display all purchasable items even if the regular npc's shop is full. (excluding the travelling merchant)
